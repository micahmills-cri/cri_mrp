# Action Items

This document tracks outstanding tasks, improvements, and technical debt for the Boat Factory Operations MVP. Items are organized by priority and include status tracking, ownership, and completion dates.

## How to Use This File

1. **Before starting work**: Review this file to understand current priorities and avoid duplicate work
2. **When planning features**: Check if related action items exist and incorporate them into your work
3. **During development**: Update item status as you progress (e.g., `[ ]` ‚Üí `[WIP]` ‚Üí `[x]`)
4. **After completing work**: Mark items as done, add completion date, and document in CHANGELOG.md
5. **When discovering new work**: Add items to the appropriate priority section with context
6. **MANDATORY for ALL agents**: When you discover ANY issue during work (testing, building, analyzing, implementing), you MUST add it to this file immediately with appropriate priority, context, estimated effort, agent role, and "Discovered: YYYY-MM-DD" tag. Failure to document discoveries means incomplete work.

**Status Indicators:**

- `[ ]` - Not started
- `[WIP]` - Work in progress (include agent role/name if applicable)
- `[x]` - Completed (include completion date)
- `[BLOCKED]` - Blocked (include blocker description)
- `[DEFERRED]` - Intentionally postponed (include reason)
