# Action Items

This document tracks outstanding tasks, improvements, and technical debt for the Boat Factory Operations MVP. Items are organized by priority and include status tracking, ownership, and completion dates.

## How to Use This File

1. **Before starting work**: Review this file to understand current priorities and avoid duplicate work
2. **When planning features**: Check if related action items exist and incorporate them into your work
3. **During development**: Update item status as you progress (e.g., `[ ]` ‚Üí `[WIP]` ‚Üí `[x]`)
4. **After completing work**: Mark items as done, add completion date, and document in CHANGELOG.md
5. **When discovering new work**: Add items to the appropriate priority section with context
6. **MANDATORY for ALL agents**: When you discover ANY issue during work (testing, building, analyzing, implementing), you MUST add it to this file immediately with appropriate priority, context, estimated effort, agent role, and "Discovered: YYYY-MM-DD" tag. Failure to document discoveries means incomplete work.

**Status Indicators:**
- `[ ]` - Not started
- `[WIP]` - Work in progress (include agent role/name if applicable)
- `[x]` - Completed (include completion date)
- `[BLOCKED]` - Blocked (include blocker description)
- `[DEFERRED]` - Intentionally postponed (include reason)

## ‚úÖ Completed Items

*(Items move here when marked complete with `[x]` status)*

### 2025-01-16
- [x] **Repository best practices analysis** (Agent: QA & Release Gate, Completed: 2025-01-16) - Completed comprehensive analysis of codebase identifying security, testing, and code quality improvements. Created this ActionItems tracking file and updated AGENTS.md workflow.
- [x] **Add ESLint configuration** (Agent: QA & Release Gate, Completed: 2025-01-16) - Installed eslint@8.57 and eslint-config-next. Created `.eslintrc.json` with Next.js defaults, Prettier integration, and no-console warning rule. Added `lint` and `lint:fix` scripts. ESLint now catches 17+ console.log warnings and formatting issues.
- [x] **Add Prettier configuration** (Agent: QA & Release Gate, Completed: 2025-01-16) - Installed prettier@3.6.2 with ESLint plugin. Created `.prettierrc` with project standards (no semicolons, single quotes, 2-space indent, trailing commas). Created `.prettierignore` for build outputs and migrations. Added `format` and `format:check` scripts. Prettier identifies 93 files needing formatting.
- [x] **JWT_SECRET validation** (Agent: Security & Permissions, Completed: 2025-01-16) - Confirmed already implemented in `src/lib/env.ts` using Zod schema validation with 32-character minimum.
