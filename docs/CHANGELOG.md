## 2025-10-27T21:00:00Z — Agent: QA & Release Gate

- **Summary:** Verified complete implementation of Departments and Work Centers CRUD UI pages. Both pages were already fully implemented at src/app/admin/departments/page.tsx and src/app/admin/work-centers/page.tsx with DataTable integration, create/edit modals, delete confirmation dialogs, CSV export support, and proper form validation. Updated ActionItems.md to move both tasks from Medium Priority to Completed Items section.
- **Reasoning:** The ActionItems.md listed these as pending UI implementations, but investigation revealed both pages already exist with complete functionality including backend API integration, soft delete patterns, dependency checking, and consistent UI patterns matching the established admin panel design. No code changes were needed - only documentation updates to reflect actual implementation status.
- **Findings:**
  - Departments page (286 lines): Full CRUD, displays user/work center counts, dependency checks before deletion, CSV export
  - Work Centers page (364 lines): Full CRUD, department selection, station/routing counts, soft delete with status badges
  - Both pages accessible via admin layout navigation at lines 78-79
  - Backend APIs already complete with validation and error handling
- **Files Modified:** docs/ActionItems.md (moved items to Completed), docs/CHANGELOG.md (this entry)
- **Hats:** qa-gate, docs.

## 2025-10-27T20:00:00Z — Agent: Docs & Runbooks

- **Summary:** Consolidated three implementation markdown files (ADMIN_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md, FINAL_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md, IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md) into a single comprehensive document at docs/ADMIN_PANEL_IMPLEMENTATION.md. Updated all related documentation (README.md, ActionItems.md, CHANGELOG.md, ONBOARDING.md, replit.md) to reflect admin panel implementation status and provide consistent references across the documentation suite.
- **Reasoning:** Three overlapping implementation files created confusion about the current state of the admin panel feature. Consolidating into a single source of truth with 10 major sections (Executive Summary, Feature Status, API Reference, Database Schema, Implementation Guide, Technical Details, UI/UX, Testing, File Structure, Troubleshooting) provides clear documentation for developers. Updated README.md to include admin panel in product features. Added remaining admin tasks and completed items to ActionItems.md. Added comprehensive admin panel changelog entries. Updated ONBOARDING.md with admin setup instructions. Updated replit.md with admin panel access information.
- **Changes Made:** (1) Created docs/ADMIN_PANEL_IMPLEMENTATION.md consolidating all three files, (2) Updated README.md Product Features and Reference Accounts sections, (3) Updated ActionItems.md with 3 medium priority and 3 low priority admin tasks plus 8 completed items, (4) Added this changelog entry documenting admin panel work, (5) Updated ONBOARDING.md with admin panel setup section, (6) Updated replit.md with admin panel reference.
- **Files Modified:** docs/ADMIN_PANEL_IMPLEMENTATION.md (new), README.md, docs/ActionItems.md, docs/CHANGELOG.md, docs/ONBOARDING.md, replit.md
- **Hats:** docs.

## 2025-10-27T19:00:00Z — Agent: Multiple (Consolidated Entry)

- **Summary:** Implemented comprehensive admin panel for workstation configuration management. Created full CRUD operations for departments, work centers, stations, users, and equipment. Implemented advanced features including pay rate history tracking, station metrics calculation infrastructure, work order cost estimation, and CSV export system. Extended database schema with 5 new models and updated seed data.
- **Reasoning:** Factory operations require centralized management of workstation configuration data including organizational hierarchy (departments, work centers, stations), personnel (users with pay rates and shift schedules), equipment assignments, and cost tracking. Admin panel provides ADMIN-only interface for managing this data with full audit trails and data integrity patterns (soft deletes, pay rate history, dependency checks).
- **Implementation Summary:**
  - Database: 5 new models (StationMember, Equipment, StationEquipment, PayRateHistory, StationMetrics), extended User and Station models
  - UI: Admin layout, 5 entity management pages with DataTable and ConfirmDialog components
  - APIs: 45+ endpoints covering full CRUD for all entities plus member/equipment management and metrics
  - Advanced Features: Automatic pay rate history, weighted average metrics calculation, work order cost estimation, CSV export
  - Security: RBAC with ADMIN-only access, soft deletes, self-deletion prevention, dependency checks
- **Files Created:** 65+ files including admin pages, API routes, shared components, utilities, and updated schema/seed files
- **Hats:** domain, schema-change, api-contract, role-ui, files, seed, security, docs.

## 2025-10-27T17:34:30Z — Agent: QA & Release Gate

- **Summary:** Added a Vitest setup mock for `@prisma/client` that preserves the real module when generated and provides enum fallbacks for `Role`, `WOStatus`, and `WOPriority` so unit tests always receive defined constants.
- **Reasoning:** Several suites import Prisma enums directly, and prior runs failed whenever the generated client was missing; stabilizing the enums in setup keeps tests deterministic across fresh installs.
- **Hats:** qa-gate.

## 2025-10-23T17:15:00Z — Agent: Docs & Runbooks

- **Summary:** Documented the supervisor planned-window helper and development login shortcuts in `replit.md`, corrected stack references to Tailwind + React 18, and logged the helper in the changelog.
- **Reasoning:** Keep contributor documentation aligned with the Oct 16 and Oct 23 feature work so onboarding developers understand current defaults and tooling expectations.
- **Hats:** docs.

## 2025-10-16T15:49:00Z — Agent: Docs & Runbooks

- **Summary:** Strengthened agent workflow to MANDATE documenting all discovered issues in ActionItems.md. Updated AGENTS.md Executive Summary (#7 requirement), Documentation & Change Management (CRITICAL section), Testing Expectations, PR Checklist, Definition of Done, and all agent role descriptions. Updated ActionItems.md "How to Use" section and ONBOARDING.md development workflow with non-negotiable discovery documentation requirement.
- **Reasoning:** Previous language was permissive ("as you discover") not imperative ("MUST add"). Agents were not consistently documenting discovered issues (test failures, build errors, bugs, warnings) in ActionItems.md, leading to lost technical debt tracking. This change makes discovery documentation mandatory across all roles and embedded in every critical workflow checkpoint (Executive Summary, PR Checklist, Definition of Done). Language is now imperative ("MUST", "CRITICAL", "non-negotiable") to eliminate ambiguity.
- **Changes Made**: (1) Added #7 to Executive Summary: "Document ALL discoveries", (2) Expanded Documentation & Change Management with 10-item discovery checklist, (3) Added test failure documentation to Testing Expectations, (4) Made PR Checklist explicit with discovery requirements, (5) Added discovery requirement to Definition of Done, (6) Added universal discovery clause to all 10 agent roles, (7) Added mandatory step #6 to ActionItems.md, (8) Emphasized requirement in ONBOARDING.md.
- **Hats:** docs, qa-gate.

## 2025-10-16T15:30:00Z — Agent: QA & Release Gate

- **Summary:** Configured ESLint (v8.57) and Prettier (v3.6.2) for consistent code quality and formatting. Created `.eslintrc.json` with Next.js defaults, no-console warnings, and Prettier integration. Created `.prettierrc` with project standards (no semicolons, single quotes, 2-space indent, trailing commas) and `.prettierignore` for build outputs. Added `lint`, `lint:fix`, `format`, and `format:check` scripts to package.json. Updated `docs/ActionItems.md` to mark ESLint and Prettier items complete and documented 6 newly discovered issues.
- **Reasoning:** Enforce consistent code style across the codebase (currently 93 files need formatting), catch potential issues early (17+ console.log warnings detected), and establish foundation for pre-commit hooks. ESLint v8 chosen for compatibility with Next.js 14 config system. Prettier config matches majority of existing code conventions.
- **Issues Discovered:** (1) 93 files need formatting with CRLF line ending issues, (2) 17 console.log warnings across codebase, (3) 4 test files failing due to Prisma enum import issues, (4) `buildKanbanColumns` export in supervisor page blocking builds, (5) Duplicate Card component border classes causing Vite warnings. All issues added to ActionItems.md for tracking.
- **Hats:** qa-gate.

## 2025-01-16T19:30:00Z — Agent: Docs & Runbooks

- **Summary:** Created `docs/ActionItems.md` to track prioritized technical debt and improvement tasks. Updated `AGENTS.md` to require checking action items before starting work and updating statuses during development. Added ActionItems reference to `docs/ONBOARDING.md` development workflow section.
- **Reasoning:** Provide a centralized, prioritized task list based on best practices analysis to coordinate work across agents, prevent duplicate efforts, and ensure important improvements don't get lost. Establishes clear workflow for claiming, tracking, and completing action items.
- **Hats:** docs, qa-gate.

## 2025-10-16T13:55:39Z — Agent: gpt-5-codex

- **Summary:** Hid the manual credential form in development, added quick-launch demo account buttons that share the login fetch helper, and kept the production form unchanged for manual sign-in flows.
- **Reasoning:** Streamline local testing by allowing one-click role switching without disrupting the production login behavior or its error handling.
- **Hats:** role-ui, qa-gate.

## 2025-10-15T16:14:46Z — Agent: gpt-5-codex

- **Summary:** Added an explicit edit workflow for supervisor planning details, including an unlock button and cancel/save controls that preserve the existing read-only view. Enabled editing across active statuses and updated the API to validate changes, record version snapshots, and allow supervisors to adjust planning dates without future-date restrictions.
- **Reasoning:** Supervisors need to adjust planning data on in-flight work orders while maintaining the audit trail and snapshot history so downstream teams see accurate priorities and schedule expectations.
- **Hats:** role-ui, api-contract, docs.

## 2025-10-15T15:40:02Z — Agent: gpt-5-codex

- **Summary:** Refined the supervisor Kanban into an accessible horizontal gallery with snap scrolling, stable gutters, and responsive column sizing while anchoring the theme toggle to the safe-area inset on touch devices.
- **Reasoning:** Ensure supervisors can browse every lane on mobile and desktop without layout overflow and keep the dark mode control unobtrusive yet reachable across devices with dynamic safe-area spacing.
- **Hats:** role-ui, qa-gate, docs.

## 2025-10-10T12:00:00Z — Agent: gpt-5-codex

- **Summary:** Enriched the supervisor dashboard API with workstation metadata, reworked the Kanban board to build dynamic work-center lanes with fallbacks, and added contract/unit tests covering the new dashboard payload and kanban grouping.
- **Reasoning:** Provide supervisors with workstation-aware visibility so the board layout matches active centers while ensuring future regressions are caught automatically.
- **Hats:** api-contract, role-ui, qa-gate.

## 2025-10-09T14:22:24Z — Agent: gpt-5-codex

- **Summary:** Rebuilt the operator console UI to consume theme-aware tokens, shared form primitives, and semantic status badges so every panel, table, and action control honors dark mode. Refreshed the product model/trim selector to lean on the shared Select/Input components, ensuring supervisor planning forms inherit the same adaptive styling.
- **Reasoning:** Replace the ad hoc inline styles that hardcoded light-theme colors so operators and supervisors get consistent, accessible experiences across light and dark themes while centralizing future styling updates.
- **Hats:** role-ui, docs, qa-gate.

## 2025-10-08T19:45:00Z — Agent: gpt-5-codex

- **Summary:** Applied theme-aware palettes to shared UI primitives, refreshed supervisor dashboard styling to respect CSS vari
  able tokens, and centralized status/priority color maps for dark-mode parity.
- **Reasoning:** Eliminate the lingering light-theme assumptions so supervisors see accessible contrast in both light and dark
  modes while keeping future component work anchored to shared tokens.

## 2025-10-08T17:30:00Z — Agent: gpt-5-codex

- **Summary:** Introduced a global theme provider and floating toggle to support persistent light/dark modes and refreshed shared styles to respect theme-aware tokens across forms, tables, and layout chrome.
- **Reasoning:** Ensure operators and supervisors can switch to a low-light friendly palette without losing readability while keeping shared UI primitives consistent.
- **Hats:** role-ui, qa-gate.

## 2025-10-08T16:05:00Z — Agent: gpt-5-codex

- **Summary:** Replaced the lightweight guidance with a comprehensive `AGENTS.md` playbook that adds an executive summary, role protocols, and reinforced domain/operational guardrails.
- **Reasoning:** Give future agents a scannable yet thorough reference so they can uphold the product invariants, testing discipline, and documentation habits without guesswork.

## 2025-10-08T15:18:59Z — Agent: gpt-5-codex

- **Summary:** Refreshed the project README to document the combined supervisor workspace, current operator capabilities, and up-to-date setup/testing guidance.
- **Reasoning:** Align the public-facing documentation with the latest product experience and developer workflow.

## 2025-10-08T14:20:00Z — Agent: gpt-5-codex

- **Summary:** Added the root `AGENTS.md` to codify coding standards, testing requirements, and documentation expectations. Established the shared change log process.
- **Reasoning:** Provide future agents with clear guardrails and traceability for their work.
