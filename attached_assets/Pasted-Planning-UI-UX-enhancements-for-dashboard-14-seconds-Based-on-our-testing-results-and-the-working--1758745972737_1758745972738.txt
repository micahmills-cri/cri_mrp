Planning UI/UX enhancements for dashboard (14 seconds) Based on our testing results and the working backend APIs, here's my comprehensive plan for the UI and UX enhancements. I want to make sure we're aligned before I start building: üéØ Enhanced Supervisor Dashboard Board Tab Enhancements Work Order List/Cards: Add attachment count badge (üìé 3) next to each work order Add recent notes preview - show latest note snippet with timestamp Add model/trim display instead of generic productSku Work Order Detail Drawer (Right Panel): Current: Shows stage timeline and basic info Add: Notes timeline section with: Chronological list of all notes Department tags (GENERAL vs specific department) Add new note button with scope selector Edit/delete for own notes Add: Attachments section with: File list with icons, names, sizes Upload new files button Download/delete actions per file Plan Tab Enhancements Work Order Creation Modal: Replace static "Product SKU" text field with: Model dropdown: LX24, LX26 Trim dropdown: LT, LE (filtered by selected model) Generated SKU display: Shows "2025-LX24-LT" automatically Year selector: Defaults to current year, allows override üìù Work Order Notes Timeline New Notes Panel Component Timeline Layout: Vertical timeline with notes as bubbles Note Cards: Show content, author, timestamp, department scope Filtering: Toggle between "All Notes" and "My Department Only" (for operators) Add Note Form: Text area for content Scope selector: "General" or "Department-Specific" Department auto-filled for current user Real-time Updates: Auto-refresh when new notes added Edit/Delete: Inline editing for own notes, with proper permissions Note Display Elements Author badges: Color-coded by role (Operator/Supervisor/Admin) Department tags: Show which department for scoped notes Timestamps: Relative ("2 hours ago") with absolute on hover Content formatting: Support for line breaks and basic formatting üìÅ File Attachments Interface File Upload Component Drag-and-drop zone: Visual feedback for file dragging File picker button: Traditional file selection as backup Upload progress: Progress bars for each file being uploaded File validation: Size limits, type restrictions with clear error messages Multiple files: Support bulk upload with individual progress tracking Attachments List File cards: Icon, name, size, upload date, uploaded by File type icons: PDF, Image, Document, etc. with visual distinction Download buttons: Direct download with proper access control Delete functionality: For file owners and supervisors Loading states: Skeleton loading while fetching attachment list üèóÔ∏è Model/Trim Integration Cascading Dropdowns Model Selection: Dropdown populated from /api/product-models Trim Selection: Dynamically filtered based on selected model Loading states: Spinners while fetching trim options Validation: Ensure trim belongs to selected model Clear functionality: Reset trim when model changes SKU Generation Display Live preview: Updates as user selects model/trim/year Format: Clear "YEAR-MODEL-TRIM" format display Validation feedback: Green checkmark when valid combination Error handling: Red error if generation fails üé® UX Flow Enhancements Navigation Pattern Supervisor opens Board tab ‚Üí sees enhanced work order cards Clicks work order ‚Üí detail drawer opens with 3 tabs: Timeline (existing) Notes (new) Files (new) Switches to Plan tab ‚Üí enhanced creation form with dropdowns Creates work order ‚Üí SKU auto-generates, files can be attached immediately Interaction Patterns Notes: Click to expand full content, double-click to edit (own notes) Files: Single-click to download, hover for actions menu Dropdowns: Type-ahead search for quick selection Upload: Drag files directly to work order detail drawer Error Handling Strategy Network errors: Retry buttons with exponential backoff File errors: Clear messaging (file too large, unsupported type) Permission errors: Explain why action not allowed Validation errors: Inline feedback with helpful suggestions Loading States Notes loading: Skeleton timeline bubbles Files loading: Skeleton file cards Upload progress: Individual file progress bars Dropdown loading: Spinner in dropdown with "Loading..." text üì± Responsive Considerations Mobile/Tablet Adaptations Detail drawer: Full-screen modal on mobile instead of side panel File upload: Larger touch targets for mobile Notes timeline: Simplified layout with larger touch areas Dropdowns: Native mobile select for better UX üîß Technical Implementation Plan Phase 1: Foundation Create reusable components: NotesTimeline, FileUpload, ModelTrimSelector Update supervisor dashboard to use new components Add API integration with proper error handling Phase 2: Enhanced Features Real-time updates for notes Advanced file management (preview, bulk operations) Search/filter functionality for notes and files Phase 3: Polish Animation and transition effects Keyboard shortcuts for power users Advanced validation and error recovery üéØ Success Metrics Usability Goals: Supervisors can add notes in <30 seconds File uploads complete with clear progress feedback Model/trim selection generates correct SKU immediately No confusion about department access (clear visual indicators) Technical Goals: Notes load in <500ms File uploads show progress within 1 second Dropdown populations complete in <200ms Zero data loss during file operations Does this plan align with your vision? Any specific areas you'd like me to adjust or elaborate on before I start implementing?
