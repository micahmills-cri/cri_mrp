# Agent Playbook

## Executive Summary — Follow These First
1. **Respect the architecture.** This is a Next.js 14 App Router app on Node 20+/TypeScript 5.9 with Prisma 6.16 + Postgres. Keep server-only code under `src/server/**`, rely on the `@/` alias, and never create ad-hoc Prisma clients.
2. **Preserve domain invariants.** Work Orders move sequentially from `PLANNED` → … → `CLOSED`, `CANCELLED` remains available, and every mutation must write both a `WorkOrderVersion` snapshot and an `AuditLog` entry.
3. **Keep data deterministic.** Treat `backup-data.ts` as the source of truth: reseeding wipes runtime additions. Align `prisma/schema.prisma`, migrations, `src/db/seed.ts`, and `backup-data.ts` before shipping.
4. **Validate and test.** Use `zod` for all API payloads and run `npm run test` (Vitest) before requesting review. Add contract/unit/E2E coverage when you touch corresponding layers.
5. **Document the change.** Update `docs/ONBOARDING.md` if flows/setup shift and append a UTC entry to `docs/CHANGELOG.md` with agent, timestamp, summary, and reasoning.

## Purpose & Context
One file that tells agents (and humans) how this MVP works, who owns what, how handoffs occur, and what “done” means—aligned to this repo.

- **Domain:** High-mix/low-volume boat factory operations managing the full Work Order (WO) lifecycle with routing versioning.
- **Roles:** `ADMIN`, `SUPERVISOR`, and `OPERATOR` with RBAC enforced across UI and API layers.
- **Key systems:** Notes timeline, file management, model/trim selector, routing (default/new/saved versions), and audit trails.
- **Default routing path:** `Kitting → Lamination → Hull Rigging → Deck Rigging → Capping → Engine Hang → Final Rigging → Water Test → QA → Cleaning → Shipping`.
- **Seeds & persistence:** `backup-data.ts` is the canonical dataset. Reseeds delete runtime records; keep long-lived fixtures mirrored there.

## Stack & Runtime Guardrails
- Next.js 14 App Router, TypeScript 5.9, Node.js 20+, default port `5000`.
- Prisma 6.16 with Postgres; middleware logs audit metadata.
- Vitest with test files under `src/**/__tests__/`.
- Path alias `@/` is mandatory for `src/` imports.
- Server-only code resides in `src/server/**` (Prisma, storage, business logic). Never import it into client components.
- API handlers live in `src/app/api/**/route.ts` and must return `NextResponse.json({ ok, data?, error? })`.
- Auth: JWT stored in HTTP-only cookies, hashed credentials with `bcryptjs`, RBAC enforced in middleware/handlers.
- Environment keys belong in `src/lib/env.ts` and `.env.example`. Current required keys: `DATABASE_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`, `STORAGE_BUCKET_ID`, `NODE_ENV`.
- Formatting: run Prettier 3 (`npx prettier@3 --write <files>`) on touched files.

## Domain Rules & Invariants
- **Work Orders:**
  - Status pipeline includes `PLANNED` through closure plus `CANCELLED`.
  - Stage progression is sequential; operators only see work scoped to their department.
  - Each mutation writes a `WorkOrderVersion` (with `id`, `workOrderId`, `versionNumber`, `snapshotData` JSON, `createdBy`, `createdAt`, `reason`) and an `AuditLog` entry. Include `schema_hash` and `versionNumber` in the snapshot payloads.
- **Routing:**
  - Default routing must reference all 11 departments above.
  - Saved versions support create/read/update/delete with consistent naming and retrieval semantics.
  - Creating a WO blocks until routing validates that every department has an active work center.
- **Notes & Timeline:**
  - Use a single `Note` model with `(entity_type, entity_id, author_role)`.
  - Timeline views combine notes, status changes, and file events ordered chronologically with department scoping.
- **Files & Storage:**
  - Use the configured `STORAGE_BUCKET_ID`; avoid hardcoded IDs or ad-hoc ACLs.
  - JWT payload uses `user.userId` (not `user.id`). Ensure uploads → storage → DB records stay consistent. Bulk operations must honor permissions.
- **Real-time & Performance:**
  - Poll endpoints roughly every 10 seconds; keep them idempotent and cache-friendly.
  - Dashboard initial load target < 1.5s on seeded data; WO detail APIs < 800ms. Prefer Prisma `_count`/aggregations and avoid N+1 queries.
- **Security:**
  - Never log secrets. JWT stays cookie-only. Enforce RBAC and department scoping in every handler. Only Supervisors can edit routing while a WO is `PLANNED`. All denied writes should produce audit attempts.

## Data Management Workflow
1. Update `prisma/schema.prisma` first, then run `npm run prisma:migrate` followed by `npm run prisma:generate`.
2. Sync fixtures in `src/db/seed.ts` and persist reference data in `backup-data.ts`.
3. Use `npm run seed:dry` to preview and `npm run seed` to apply deterministic seeds.
4. Include model/trim coverage (e.g., LX24 Base/Sport/Luxury; LX26 Base/Sport/Luxury/Premium) and sample WOs across statuses.

## Testing Expectations
- **Baseline:** `npm run test` must pass before submission.
- **Contract tests:** Add/update Vitest contract suites for any touched API route.
- **Unit tests:** Cover validators, snapshot writers, routing logic, etc.
- **E2E (when present):** Exercise happy paths for supervisor routing flows, operator dashboards, file management, and cancellation handling.
- **Performance checks:** Spot-check that critical endpoints remain within the performance targets above.

## Documentation & Change Management
- Update `docs/ONBOARDING.md` whenever setup steps, env variables, or major flows change.
- Maintain `docs/CHANGELOG.md` with newest entry first, including agent name, ISO 8601 UTC timestamp, summary, and reasoning per PR.
- Keep ADRs under `docs/adr/` current; add new ones when architecture decisions shift.

## Operational Protocol
- **Task Spec Template**
  ```yaml
  task: "Routing defaults & validation"
  owner: "Routing & Work Centers"
  context:
    related_issues: [#123]
    risk: "Medium — block create WO until valid routing"
  acceptance_criteria:
    - Default 11-dept routing applies when selected
    - Create New Routing saves version; appears in Saved list
    - Validation blocks create until all 11 depts have active work centers
  test_plan:
    contract:
      - "POST /api/work-orders validates routing"
      - "GET /api/work-centers returns active entries"
    unit:
      - "routing validator"
      - "version save"
    e2e:
      - "create WO with default routing succeeds"
      - "invalid routing blocked with clear error"
  rollback:
    - "revert migration N; keep backup of backup-data.ts snapshot"
  artifacts:
    - "schema diff"
    - "screenshots/gifs of flows"
  ```
- **Solo agents:** If you are the only agent on a task, you may assume multiple roles below. Explicitly note which hats you wore in the changelog entry.
- **Handoffs:** When passing work, summarize progress, outstanding risks, and relevant test results. Reference the task spec in your PR description.

## Role Playbook & Ownership Labels
For multi-agent efforts, align work with the primary owner. Solo agents should still follow the expectations for each area they touch.

1. **Product Architect** (`domain`)
   - Owns domain model, invariants, ADRs. Outputs include ADRs in `docs/adr/`, schema diffs, migration plans. Done when ADR merged and migrations unblock others.
2. **DB Migration & Versioning** (`schema-change`)
   - Maintains schema evolution, WO snapshots, audit integrity. Ensures `priority` enum (`LOW`, `NORMAL`, `HIGH`, `CRITICAL`) and `WOStatus` includes `CANCELLED`. Verifies `WorkOrderVersion` hooks for create/update/status. Done when migrations succeed up/down, seeds align, and rollback instructions exist.
3. **API & Contracts** (`api-contract`)
   - Builds typed, zod-validated handlers with stable response contracts. Done when contract tests cover all changed routes.
4. **UI/UX Implementer** (`role-ui`)
   - Delivers role dashboards and detail flows without raw JSON forms. Supervisor must create WOs, pick routing (Default/New/Saved), save milestones, and use unified timeline. Operator dashboard handles queues, START/PAUSE/COMPLETE, notes, attachments with department scope. Board (Kanban) and Table share headers; Create Work Order buttons visible. Done when UX checklist and E2E happy paths (if available) pass.
5. **Notes & Timeline Unifier** (`notes-timeline`)
   - Maintains single notes system + cross-entity timeline; removes legacy paths; migrates data safely. Done when history preserved and old tables removed.
6. **Routing & Work Centers** (`routing`)
   - Ensures default routing, saved versions, validation. Done when WO creation blocks invalid routing and version CRUD validated.
7. **Files & Storage** (`files`)
   - Handles upload/list/search/bulk flows with stable ACLs. Confirms JWT user id usage and end-to-end storage integrity. Done when bulk ops tested.
8. **Data Fixtures & Seeding** (`seed`)
   - Produces deterministic dev/E2E data aligned with `backup-data.ts`. Done when environment bootstraps from zero via one command.
9. **QA & Release Gate** (`qa-gate`)
   - Enforces Definition of Done: `tsc` clean, Prettier applied, tests green, migrations up/down, perf sanity, E2E (if configured).
10. **Security & Permissions** (`security`)
    - Oversees JWT/cookie, RBAC, department scoping. Ensures only Supervisors edit routing while WO is `PLANNED`, operators restricted appropriately, every write audited, and denial cases tested.
11. **Docs & Runbooks** (`docs`)
    - Keeps documentation in sync: `AGENTS.md`, `API_CONTRACT.md`, `MIGRATIONS.md`, `docs/ONBOARDING.md`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`. Done when docs updated alongside code.

## PR Checklist
- ☐ Prettier 3 run on touched files.
- ☐ `npm run prisma:migrate` (if schema changed) and `npm run prisma:generate` succeed.
- ☐ Seeds updated (`src/db/seed.ts`) and `backup-data.ts` adjusted if reference data changed.
- ☐ Contract/unit/E2E tests updated or added for affected areas.
- ☐ Docs refreshed (including ONBOARDING/CHANGELOG) and changelog entry added with UTC timestamp.
- ☐ Performance/accessibility baselines still met; call out deviations in the PR.

## Core Flows to Validate Before Shipping
- Supervisor creates `PLANNED` WO → selects Default/New/Saved routing → saves version → releases.
- Operator dashboard: pick `READY` WO → `START`/`PAUSE`/`COMPLETE` → add note and file (department scoped).
- Board (Kanban) and Table views share headers; `Create Work Order` button accessible.
- Timeline displays unified notes/status/file events with counts.
- Cancelling a WO records snapshot + audit and surfaces correctly in UI filters.
- Full reseed from zero: models/trims and WOs reappear; no data silently lost.
- File management: upload → list/search → bulk delete using `user.userId`.

## Ready-Made Prompts (Repo-Aware)
- “Fix routing validation end-to-end” — Add `zod` schemas for routing payloads, enforce 11 departments with active work centers in `POST /api/work-orders`, surface actionable UI errors, and cover with contract/unit/UI tests.
- “Unify notes & timeline” — Migrate to single `Note` model, build timeline union (notes/status/files), remove legacy paths, and test contract/unit/UI flows.
- “Snapshot writer & audit” — Ensure snapshots on WO create/update/status change include `schema_hash` and `versionNumber`. Cover with unit + contract tests.

## Definition of Done
- Code, migrations, and seeds merged without regressions.
- API contracts verified with Vitest suites and remain backwards compatible.
- Seeds and `backup-data.ts` updated to reflect new truths.
- Documentation updated (`AGENTS.md`, onboarding, ADRs, changelog, etc.).
- Changelog entry appended with reasoning and timestamp.
